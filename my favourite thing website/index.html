    <!-- Drive rc cars -->
    <h2>2.Drive RC Cars</h2>
    <p>
      now I know what your thinking, "rc cars are just cheap toys that break
      easily." And you would be right. But, the kind of rc's i'm into are called
      "Hobby Grade RC cars", meaning they are pretty much high quality
      mini-cars. There are also 2 main types of hobby rc cars: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instructables.com/The-COMPLETE-Guide-to-RC-Cars/"> electric</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLBFFx9RGod6I-arzxNMtRP8ZcBPtg_hTe"> Rock crawler</a>. Some major brands that sell hobby grade rc cars are:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://traxxas.com/" target="_blank">traxxas</a>(mainly sells electric rc cars)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.axialadventure.com/" target="_blank">Axial</a>(mainly sells Rock Crawlers)</li>
      </ul>
      there is also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovetVhxITNk">Gas powered</a>
    </p>
    <!-- off roading with ATV's -->
    <h2>3.Off Roading with ATV's</h2>
    <p>The 3rd thing on my list is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.polaris.com/en-ca/off-road/articles/buying-guides/beginners-guide-for-off-roading-adventures/">Off-Roading with ATV's</a>. ATVing is pretty much just getting on an ATV and riding trails, but of course you have to be safe and wear a helmet and other protective gear in which I do. But the reason why I like it so much is Its a nice thing I do with my dad. We have a family farm that has trails through the bush that we ride up and down, but sometimes we go on public trails.</p>
